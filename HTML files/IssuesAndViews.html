            <h3>Child Labour</h3>


            <p>

                More than 200 million children worldwide are still working as child labourers and a staggering 115
                million at least, are subject to its worst forms. As per the National Census 2011, there are close to
                10.1 million child labourers in India, in the age group of 5 to 14 years.

            <ul>
                <li> 10.13 million child labourers between 5-14 years in India (2011 Census data)</li>
                <li>Child labour in 2011 has decreased by around 20% from 2001 Census Figures</li>
                <li>There are 22.87 million working children in India between 15-18 years.</li>
                <li>As per 2011 Census, 1 in 11 children are working in India (5-18 years)</li>
                <li>80% of the child labour in India is concentrated in rural areas.</li>
                <li> ILO 2016 data indicates that there are 152 million working children in the world between 5-17
                    years, of
                    which 23.8 million children are in India. So 16% of the working children (or every 6th working
                    child) in this age group is in India</li>
            </ul>

            About 1.4 million child labourers in India in the age group of 7-14 years can’t write their names,
            analysis of Census data by CRY- Child Rights and You reveals. This means one in three child labourers in
            the said age group are illiterate. This is the grim reality of children who work for more than six
            months in a year. Even for children who support the family economy by working for less than six months
            in a year, which is very common in a country like India, the situation is equally, if not more, worse. A
            shocking 2 million of these marginal workers have compromised their education as well.
            <br><br>
            There is a high potential of early school leavers and those not learning at school to remain outside the
            world of formal employment. These children when they grow remain at a risk of not having secured jobs
            and thus remain trapped in the intergenerational cycle of poverty and deprivation. It is imperative to
            relook at what we as a nation are investing in our children’s education. It has been a decade since the
            notification of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 and it is crucial
            that its implementation is strengthened. The ambit of the RTE Act, 2009 must be expanded to from
            pre-school to secondary level (for children aged 3 years – 18 years) in order to address this issue.
            <br><br>
            The situation is also reflected in the state figures. While 45% of child labourers in Bihar are
            illiterate, in Rajasthan and Jharkhand the figure stands at 40%. Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh also
            have about 38% child labourers as illiterate.
            With the education indicators for these children plummeting, the reasons why we face this challenge
            needs to be addressed. India’s present legal framework is based on the assumption that children can work
            and study simultaneously. The numbers stated earlier blatantly contradict this assumption and are
            evidence enough that this needs to change, for main as well as marginal child labourers. In 2016, the
            Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 was amended by which the law bans child labour (i.e.
            those below14 years) and links the to the age of entry into employment with the age of completion of
            elementary education (14 years) guaranteed by the Right to Education Act (RTE), 2009. However, it makes
            certain exceptions for children in this age group and allows them to ‘help’ family and in family
            enterprises, and as child artists, after school hours or during vacations.
            <br><br>
            The Census 2011 data for children in labour, states that 6.5 million children in India in the age group
            of 5 to 14 years work in agriculture and household industries. This makes a staggering 64.1% of child
            labourers in this age group. CRY’s on ground experience reveals that a large number of children engaged
            in these occupations are working with their families. Allowing children to work in family enterprises is
            likely to have far reaching implications affecting not only their education and learning outcomes but
            also their health and overall development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to revisit the law in the
            interest of all children.
            <br><br>
            Child labour in India, somehow, has become a social norm that we accept and tolerate in our society.
            This exploitative and abusive practice will continue unless society adopts a zero tolerance attitude
            towards it. Children continue to be exploited and abused because the State and people do not address
            children’s issues comprehensively and effectively.
            <br><br>
            However, only ‘rescuing’ children, often will not help. What is required is addressing the reasons that
            force children to work. Children work mainly to help their families because the adults do not have
            appropriate employment and adequate income. Children also work because there is a demand for cheap
            labour in the market. When children are forced to work long hours their ability to get adequate
            nourishment and to attend school is limited, preventing them from gaining education.
            <br><br>
            Our efforts towards the prevention of child labour include:
            Identifying the root causes which force families and communities to allow children to be engaged in
            labour
            Addressing these underlying issues by interacting with parents, community leaders and children’s
            collective where the importance of child rights and the damaging effects of child labour are discussed
            Empowering communities with the knowledge to demand for proper implementation of employment schemes,
            food security and access to all government provisions
            In instances of child trafficking and children forced into labour, we and grassroots partners work on
            rescue, repatriation and rehabilitation of children through child protection networks under the Juvenile
            Justice Care & Protection Act and the Integrated Child Protection Scheme
            Donation-Club and its partners work to create and strengthen ‘Children’s Collectives’. These forums create a
            platform for school-going children to play an important role in influencing children who are out of
            school to get enrolled/re-enrolled. They are also instrumental in voicing their opinions to parents,
            panchayats, government bodies and decision makers on issues related to child labour and the need for
            education.
            Donate now and strengthen our efforts of ensuring children go to school, instead of work. Help us help
            them unlearn those skills which rob them of their childhood.

            <h3>Malnutrition In India</h3>

            <p>
                India has the maximum number of malnourished children in the world – 1 in every 3 children are
                malnourished. The situation is extremely critical because the effects of malnourishment are irreversible
                if they occur at a young age. If not death, it leads to permanent disabilities that render the children
                ill for the rest of their lives.
                <br><br>
                Malnutrition in India has become a situation that haunts the lives of millions of children. Among the
                472 million children (2011 census), a whopping 97 million are anaemic and undernourished. For children
                five years or younger, close to 40% (actually 38.7%) are stunted (below normal height for the age),
                19.8% are wasted (underweight and short) and 42.4% are underweight. The data-set revealed by the latest
                NFHS-4, states that nine out of the 11 states surveyed have not been able to reduce the rate of Infant
                Mortality even by 2 points annually. And that, 40 out of 1000 infants don’t get to celebrate their first
                birthday.
                <br><br>
                While Malnutrition and Infant Mortality Rates remain high, the budget allocated for minors, constituting
                40% of India’s population remains at a meagre 4%. For example, in the village of Damodar Mohuli in
                Bihar, the only anganwadi in the village has been non-functional for the past 6 months. The anganwadi
                worker has not received her salary for this time period, and doesn’t open the centre due to lack of food
                and medicines. The children are suffering as a result.
                <br><br>
                A sound foundation is critical for the overall development of a human being. In fact, 90% development of
                the brain occurs within 5-6 years of age. Thus, to ensure a right start to life, early childhood care
                and learning is exceedingly important. The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) is one of the
                largest public service schemes in India catering to the need of children below the age of 6 years. This
                scheme, implemented from 1,974 onwards, has the potential to have the most comprehensive coverage.
                <br><br>
                Sadly, the reality is otherwise. The budget allocation for the ICDS scheme has declined by 9.6%, from
                15,584 Cr (RE 2015-16) to 14,862 Cr (BE 2016-17). Some states like Maharashtra have seen a significant
                cut (from 3,463 crores in 2015-16 {RE} to 1,307 crores {2016-17} BE). This, for a scheme that is still
                only able to cover 50% of the child population of the country and clearly requires more investment.
                <br><br>
                Due to all these issues and set-backs, right now several children, women and communities are fighting
                the long-term ill-effects of malnourishment, chronic hunger, lack of health-care and unstable
                livelihoods.
                <br><br>
                Here are a few more statistics and information on the present situation:
                <br><br>
                Children:
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li> 19.8 million children below age 6 in India are undernourished (ICDS 2015)</li>
                <li>Only 9.6% of children between 6-23 months in the country receive an adequate diet (NFHS 4, 2015-16)
                </li>
                <li> 38% (1 in 3 )of children between 0-5 years are stunted in the country (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
                <li> 21% (1 in 5) of the children in the country suffer from wasting (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
                <li> 36% of children under 5 years of age are underweight in India (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
                <li> 58% of children between 6months – 5 years were found to be anaemic in the country (NFHS 4, 2015-16)
                </li>
                <li> Total Immunisation coverage in the country stood at 62% in 2015-16 (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
                <li>21% of the births in the country were home births (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Maternal Health:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Only 21% of mothers (1 in 5) received full antenatal care in the country (NFHS 4, 2015-16) </li>
                <li>More than 50% of the pregnant women aged 15-49 years were found to be anaemic (NFHS 4, 2015-16)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Donation-Club realises this issue and works at the grassroots level with its partner organisations to ensure
            that
            communities become aware about malnutrition and informed about the situation of children and act towards
            bringing a positive change.
            <br><br>
            Donation-Club’s efforts to prevent malnutrition and eradicate it from the roots focuses on the following:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> The pregnant mother, because with proper pre-natal care, adequate food and timely health check-ups,
                    a
                    pregnant woman stays fit and gives birth a healthy child. Without it she transfers her ill-health to
                    her
                    unborn child, and sets off a cycle of malnourishment.</li>
                <li>Proper immunisation procedure, as lack of healthcare during the first two years of a child’s life
                    can
                    contribute to a lifetime of ill health. Timely polio drops, immunisation and monitored development,
                    are
                    crucial to preventing malnourishment.</li>
                <li> Wholesome nutrition because it is not enough to feed hunger. Without essential micronutrients like
                    iodine, iron and vitamins, children suffer brain damage, night blindness, rickets, anaemia and even
                    heart failure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Poverty</h3>

            <p>
                Poverty in India has been cited as one of the main reasons why millions of children do not get access to
                the rights they are entitled to. India, being home to every sixth child in the world (Ministry of
                Statistics and Programme Implementation- MoSPI, 2012), has not been able to ensure the Right to
                Survival, Right to Development, Right to Protection and Right to Participation to its children.
                <br><br>
                Any issue that causes a child rights violation like female foeticide or child labour, is a symptom of
                deep-rooted problems such as lack of livelihoods, caste or gender bias. Poverty and the problems arising
                from it, often hit the children in the worst manner because they are the most vulnerable.
                <br><br>
                While tackling the issues that poverty has given rise to, ‘charity’ alone is not a lasting solution to
                enable change for the millions of children living in India today, who have little or no access to food
                or education and are exploited daily. A rights-based approach ensures that entitlements are available to
                all children without any discrimination. They are universal and non–negotiable.

            <h3>Education And Illiteracy</h3>

            <p>
                Education is one of the most effective agents of change in society. When a child is able to go to school today, he or she sets off a cycle of positive change. But, thousands of children in India lack access to education and can’t even write their own names. Moreover, underprivileged children between the ages of 11 to 14 years are hugely vulnerable to dropping out of schools. An educated child stays away from an early marriage and is empowered to stand up against exploitation. As children grow, they are able to make better choices for themselves and influence the communities they live in. This transforms their present life and ensures a secure future for them.

But even today, one of the major problems is rampant illiteracy in India. The literacy rate in the country stands at 74.04% (according to the National Census, 2011). When it comes to children, the effects of illiteracy are manifold.
<br><br>
While the goal of universal elementary education is a long way from being achieved, and affects the condition of education for children, even adult illiteracy has effects on them. Statistics have shown that children of uneducated mothers are more prone to problems like malnutrition and anaemia. Illiterate adults are also less likely to send their children to school. Education is, in all probability, the most influential tool required to break the vicious intergenerational cycle of abuse, malnutrition, poverty and oppression. Literacy thus requires a lot of attention.
<br><br>
In addition to this, about 35% children in India with disabilities remain out of Elementary school (District Information System for Education – DISE, 2011-12) and the National Dropout Rate at the Elementary Level is over 40% (DISE, 2011-12).
<br><br>
Unless these underlying causes are dealt with, the situation for children will not change. Donation-Club, along with its partner organisations are working at the grassroots level to make sure that children do not have to face these barriers and can fully exercise their right to education.
