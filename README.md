##Donate Club: Donation listing platform for NGO's

**Problem Statement**
Many people want to donate things and their time for a better cause and
NGO’s and other organizations need donations. But they often find difficulty
finding each other. This is due to an absence of a centralized system
connecting the two.
**Solution**
Our team has come up with an ONLINE PLATFORM that will help to connect
the people who want to donate and NGO’s who want their donations.
DonateClub will provide a listing platform for donations and services, a
marketing channel and an encouraging environment for more donations and
help.
NGO’s will be able to ADD PRODUCTS they need and people will be able to
contact the NGO when they want to DONATE the same. And NGO’s will be
able to manage the inventory efficiently.
People will be able to LIST PRODUCTS that they want to donate and
organizations and individuals can REQUEST to accept that donation.
NGO’s will be able to list the SERVICES they need and people who are willing
to donate their time will be able to APPLY for the same
NGO’s will be able to have a BLOG that can showcase what they have been
doing and what are their plans for the future and this may act as their
marketing channel.
